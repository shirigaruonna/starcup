      ─────────────────────────────────────────────
      [mono]The previously reported defect affecting the
      environmental protections of our bluespace
      capsule units has been corrected, and future
      units shipped should protect from hazards in
      the field without incident.

      Cybersun would also like to recommend that
      SyndComm employees review the terms of the
      arbitration clause included in their
      employment contract before contacting our
      legal teams on this matter. Your
      understanding is appreciated.
