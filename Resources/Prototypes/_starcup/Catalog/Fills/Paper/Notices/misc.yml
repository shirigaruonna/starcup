      Congratulations! Your workplace is now operating on the next version of our BlueBox mail teleporter technology. Enjoy a redesigned look and a broader service network ensuring [bold]new and exciting deliveries![/bold]

      Be sure to inform all employees of the following:

      • Mail must now be [bold]opened by hand via fingerprint scanner rather than using an ID card or PDA.[/bold] Note that our high-tech scanning technology bypasses gloves!

      • Received mail must be [bold]retrieved from the teleporter's internal storage.[/bold]

      • Our new all-recycled packaging is regrettably more vulnerable to puncturing than before. This means that [bold]mail can now be forcibly opened using any cutting tool.[/bold]

      • Until the interns have completed their training on the new units, [bold]tailored parcels from SyndComm will be unavailable.[/bold]
